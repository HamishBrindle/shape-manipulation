# Shape Manipulation Using JS
An excercise in transformation matrices and shapes using JS.

## How to Use
Using the button farthest to the left, select TWO files from the assets/data folder that correspond with eachother
(example: Blines3D.200810.dat needs to be selected with Bpoints3D.200810.dat - mind the '3D' parts of the file names too.)
